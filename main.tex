%% ABSTRACT
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
%\newpage
\begin{abstract}

We present the study of the total hadronic positive kaon-argon nucleus interaction cross section performed at the LArIAT experiment. The LArIAT beamline instruments are used to identify candidate kaons and measure their momentum prior to entering the liquid argon time projection chamber (LArTPC). We then use the calorimetric reconstruction of the LArTPC to perform the measurement of the total differential cross section for interacting kaons ($K$) on an argon (Ar) nucleus. The $K^+$-Ar total interaction cross section has never been measured before and it is fundamental to shed light on light meson interactions in nuclei. Additionally, this measurement provides a key input to proton decay studies in future Liquid Argon Time Projection Chamber (LArTPC) experiments such as DUNE.
